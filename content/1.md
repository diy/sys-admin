# Set up Virtual Machine with Ubuntu

![comp in comp](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/compincomp.png)

A **virtual machine** is like a computer within a computer. You take a little bit of hard drive space from your computer and can install another operating system or server on it that is *totally separate* from your real computer (referred to as the *host* computer). The photo above shows my Ubuntu VM - just a window open on my normal computer, but also another whole, separate operating system.

**Ubuntu** is a free, open source operating system. This is a great way to have something to learn about servers and networks on without risking messing up anything on your normal computer. 

## Install Virtual Box & Ubuntu Desktop

Virtual Box creates an environment for your other operatign system or server to live on. [Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install it.

Next, we'll install the Ubuntu operating system. We can skip all the configuration steps and long install by using an already setup version, called an *image*. [Download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualboximage/files/Ubuntu%20Linux/12.04/ubuntu_12.04-x86.7z) the 12.04 version. The default username/password is ubuntu/reserve.

* *To unzip the file, you may need to install a 7z archiver like [7zx for Mac](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20526/7zx).*
* *If prompted for an Extension Pack, you can [download that here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html#extpack). Pick the one for your host operating system.*
* *If you find the keyboard keys to be mismatched: click System Settings > Keyboard > Layout Settings and add English US.*
