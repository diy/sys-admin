# Check Processes with htop

**htop** lets you see what processes on your Ubuntu VM are taking up the most of your CPU (Central Processing Unit) or memory. It's easy to install. In terminal type:

    sudo apt-get htop

That's it. To use it, type: 

    htop

![htop](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/htop.png)

You'll see a screen like the one above, detailing the processes running. There are different ways to organize what you're seeing. For instance, if you press **F6**, you can change how the list is sorted. By default it's sorted by CUP usage, but maybe you want to sort by Memory usage. You can use the arrow keys to scroll up, down, left and right as well. More information on the key commands can be found [here](http://linux.die.net/man/1/htop).

#### To complete the challenge, install and run htop and take a screenshot of it.
