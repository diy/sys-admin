# Lockdown Server with Firewall

A **firewall** creates a barrier between your computer and the rest of the world when connected to the internet or a network. Sys Admins are pros at customizing firewalls - knowing what ports to block or leave open, 	to protect and use their servers.

Let's install a firewall on our Ubuntu server, called *Uncomplicated Firewall*, and set a few options. In Terminal: 

    sudo apt-get ufw

![ufw settings](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/ufwsettings.png)

Now, for the settings. By **default deny** access to ports: 

    sudo ufw default deny

Turn on **logging** so you can keep track of the firewall's history:

    sudo ufw logging on

Allow **80/tcp** connections which are standard *http://* web requests, so that you can host websites:

    sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

Allow access to port **22**, the default SSH port, so that you can access your server from other places:

    sudo ufw allow 22

Turn the **firewall on**:

    sudo ufw enable

Finally, check the **status** to verify your settings are as you want them:

    sudo ufw status
