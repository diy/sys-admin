# Write a Shell Script

Your **shell** is what lets you command your computer to do things, **bash** is the language to write those commands. You can write scripts that you excute from the command line to control your computer and automate things. We'll start with a simple script. 

![ran script](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/ranclear.png)

## Make a Directory for your Scripts

In Terminal, make a new directory (aka folder) named **bin**:

    mkdir bin

## Write Script

![the script](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/myscript.png)

Open the *Text Editor* in Ubunutu and write the script below. You'll always need **#!/bin/bash** at the top of your shell scripts, it tells the system what type of script this is.

    #!/bin/bash

    # clear the screen
    clear
    # make a variable with a phrase
    STRING = "Fresh screen!"
    # print the variable in Terminal
    echo $PRINT

Now save the file in your *bin* folder. You can give it a name like, *myscript*, you don't need an extension.

## Run Script

Next, to make running scripts easier, we'll add our home path, which is **:/**, to the default group of paths that the computer checks when a command is entered.

    export PATH=$PATH:./

You should now restart your Ubuntu, you can do this by clicking the settings icon at the top right.

When you boot back up, re-open terminal and type:

    myscript

Bam! It clears your Terminal screen and shows your message!
