# Fetch Ubuntu Updates

Now that you've got Ubuntu up and running on a virtual machine, lets check for updates and install them. 

Click *Dash Home* and then search for *Terminal* and open it up. It's Bash just like we've used in [Open Sourcerer](http://www.diy.org/skills/opensourcerer), [Frontend Dev](http://www.diy.org/skills/frontenddev) and [Backend Dev](http://www.diy.org/skills/backenddev). 

To get updates, in Terminal type:

    sudo apt-get update

Typing **sudo** before your commands allows you to do things administrative things install software on the system. Next, to upgrade type:

    sudo apt-get upgrade

#### To complete the challange, take a screenshot of your updating in Terminal.
